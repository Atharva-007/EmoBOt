## Project Health Status

### âœ… Working Components

## Conclusion
The project has been successfully cleaned and is now in a **healthy, working state**. All critical errors have been resolved, tests are passing, and the app can build and run successfully. The remaining 84 issues are all deprecation warnings and code style suggestions that do not affect functionality.
