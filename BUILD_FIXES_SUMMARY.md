# Build Fixes Summary

## Issues Fixed

### 1. ✅ NDK Version Mismatch
**Problem**: Project was configured with Android NDK 26.3.11579264, but plugins required 27.0.12077973
**Solution**: Updated `android/app/build.gradle.kts` to use NDK version 27.0.12077973

### 2. ✅ minSdkVersion Too Low
**Problem**: minSdkVersion was 21, but Firebase Auth requires at least 23
**Solution**: Already corrected - minSdk set to 23 in build.gradle.kts

### 3. ✅ compileSdk Version Too Low
**Problem**: Some plugins required compileSdk 35, but project was using 34
**Solution**: Updated compileSdk from 34 to 35 in `android/app/build.gradle.kts`

### 4. ✅ targetSdk Version Updated
**Problem**: targetSdk was 34, updated for consistency
**Solution**: Updated targetSdk from 34 to 35 in `android/app/build.gradle.kts`

### 5. ✅ Resource Linking Error
**Problem**: `ic_notification.xml` referenced non-existent `?attr/colorOnPrimary`
**Solution**: Replaced `android:tint="?attr/colorOnPrimary"` with `android:tint="@android:color/white"`

## Final Configuration

### build.gradle.kts Updates:
```kotlin
android {
    namespace = "com.example.emubot_flutter"
    compileSdk = 35
    ndkVersion = "27.0.12077973"
    
    defaultConfig {
        minSdk = 23
        targetSdk = 35
        // ...
    }
}
```

### Resource Fix:
```xml
<!-- android/app/src/main/res/drawable/ic_notification.xml -->
<vector xmlns:android="http://schemas.android.com/apk/res/android"
    android:tint="@android:color/white">
    <!-- ... -->
</vector>
```

## ✅ Build Status: SUCCESS

- **Gradle Build**: ✅ Successful
- **Flutter Build**: ✅ Successful  
- **APK Generation**: ✅ Working

## Notes

- Build cache was cleaned to ensure old configurations didn't interfere
- All major build errors have been resolved
- App is now ready for development and deployment
- Some deprecation warnings exist (withOpacity) but these don't affect functionality
- Emulator warnings about package location are non-critical system issues

## Next Steps

The app can now be run using:
```bash
flutter run
# or
flutter build apk --debug
# or
flutter build apk --release
```
